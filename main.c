/*
5. Simulation of dynamic periodic task execution. A pre-defined set of routines (with unique
assigned name) shall be defined in advance with given processor usage, period and
deadline. Every routine shall be composed of a program loop followed by a nanosleep() call.
The exact amount of CPU time and consequently of the processor utilization can be done in
advance using the time Linux command. The execution supervisor shall listen in TCP/IP for
requests for task activation/deactivation. The received message shall specify the name of
the task to be activated. A given task can be activated multiple times, starting every time a
new thread running the selected routine. Before accepting a request for a new task, a
response time analysis shall be carried out in order to assess the schedulability of the
system.
